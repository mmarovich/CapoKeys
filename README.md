# CapoKeys

## Description

This is a mobile app for finding key transpositions.  It is an exercise in React Native and Redux, and follows the tutorial by [Barry Michael Doyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHzc5PjFg0U&list=PL06z42zB6YZ-9CQDX015uaeqMcSErKbes).

This was a really fun tutorial, and although I already knew how to build a React Native project, I still learned a lot about how to structure my projects and using cleaner syntax for handling my actions and reducers.

Thanks Barry!
